###How to Run Restaurant
  + Press the Start Button (or Ctrl+F11)
  + I have no starting waiters. Therefore, click on the waiter tab,
    fill in a name, and press 'Add Person' to add the waiter. A button
    should come up in the list.
  + I have no starting customers. Therefore, click on the customer tab,
    fill in a name, and press 'Add Person' to add the person. A button
    should come up in the list. You can check the Hungry Checkbox if you 
    wish to make the customer hungry immediately.
  + You can click on a customer at anytime to view their information. If 
    they are not hungry, you can click the hungry checkbox in the information
    panel to make them hungry again.
  + The front desk is located in the top left corner, the kitchen is located
    in the bottom right. 
  + You can click 'Add Table' to add up to 9 tables.
  + You can click "Pause" to pause or resume the agents at anytime. The agents
    will finish what they are doing before pausing.

###Issues
